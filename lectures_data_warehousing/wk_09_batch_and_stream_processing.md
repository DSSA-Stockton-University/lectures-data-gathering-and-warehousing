Batch processing
Service (online): waits for a request, sends a response back
Batch processing system (offline): takes a large amount of input data, runs a job to process it, and produces some output.
Stream processing systems (near-real-time): a stream processor consumes input and produces outputs. A stream job operates on events shortly after they happen.
Batch processing with Unix tools
We can build a simple log analysis job to get the five most popular pages on your site

cat /var/log/nginx/access.log |
  awk '{print $7}' |
  sort             |
  uniq -c          |
  sort -r -n       |
  head -n 5        |
You could write the same thing with a simpel program.

The difference is that with Unix commands automatically handle larger-than-memory datasets and automatically paralelizes sorting across multiple CPU cores.

Programs must have the same data format to pass information to one another. In Unix, that interface is a file (file descriptor), an ordered sequence of bytes.

By convention Unix programs treat this sequence of bytes as ASCII text.

The unix approach works best if a program simply uses stdin and stdout. This allows a shell user to wire up the input and output in whatever way they want; the program doesn't know or care where the input is coming from and where the output is going to.

Part of what makes Unix tools so successful is that they make it quite easy to see what is going on.

Map reduce and distributed filesystems
A single MapReduce job is comparable to a single Unix process.

Running a MapReduce job normally does not modify the input and does not have any side effects other than producing the output.

While Unix tools use stdin and stdout as input and output, MapReduce jobs read and write files on a distributed filesystem. In Hadoop, that filesystem is called HDFS (Haddoop Distributed File System).

HDFS is based on the shared-nothing principe. Implemented by centralised storage appliance, often using custom hardware and special network infrastructure.

HDFS consists of a daemon process running on each machine, exposing a network service that allows other nodes to access files stored on that machine. A central server called the NameNode keeps track of which file blocks are stored on which machine.

File blocks are replciated on multiple machines. Reaplication may mean simply several copies of the same data on multiple machines, or an erasure coding scheme such as Reed-Solomon codes, which allow lost data to be recovered.

MapReduce is a programming framework with which you can write code to process large datasets in a distributed filesystem like HDFS.

Read a set of input files, and break it up into records.
Call the mapper function to extract a key and value from each input record.
Sort all of the key-value pairs by key.
Call the reducer function to iterate over the sorted key-value pairs.
Mapper: Called once for every input record, and its job is to extract the key and value from the input record.
Reducer: Takes the key-value pairs produced by the mappers, collects all the values belonging to the same key, and calls the reducer with an interator over that collection of vaues.
MapReduce can parallelise a computation across many machines, without you having ot write code to explicitly handle the parallelism. THe mapper and reducer only operate on one record at a time; they don't need to know where their input is coming from or their output is going to.

In Hadoop MapReduce, the mapper and reducer are each a Java class that implements a particular interface.

The MapReduce scheduler tries to run each mapper on one of the machines that stores a replica of the input file, putting the computation near the data.

The reduce side of the computation is also partitioned. While the number of map tasks is determined by the number of input file blocks, the number of reduce tasks is configured by the job author. To ensure that all key-value pairs with the same key end up in the same reducer, the framework uses a hash of the key.

The dataset is likely too large to be sorted with a conventional sorting algorithm on a single machine. Sorting is performed in stages.

Whenever a mapper finishes reading its input file and writing its sorted output files, the MapReduce scheduler notifies the reducers that they can start fetching the output files from that mapper. The reducers connect to each of the mappers and download the files of sorted key-value pairs for their partition. Partitioning by reducer, sorting and copying data partitions from mappers to reducers is called shuffle.

The reduce task takes the files from the mappers and merges them together, preserving the sort order.

MapReduce jobs can be chained together into workflows, the output of one job becomes the input to the next job. In Hadoop this chaining is done implicitly by directory name: the first job writes its output to a designated directory in HDFS, the second job reads that same directory name as its input.

Compared with the Unix example, it could be seen as in each sequence of commands each command output is written to a temporary file, and the next command reads from the temporary file.

It is common in datasets for one record to have an association with another record: a foreign key in a relational model, a document reference in a document model, or an edge in graph model.

If the query involves joins, it may require multiple index lookpus. MapReduce has no concept of indexes.

When a MapReduce job is given a set of files as input, it reads the entire content of all of those files, like a full table scan.

In analytics it is common to want to calculate aggregates over a large number of records. Scanning the entire input might be quite reasonable.

In order to achieve good throughput in a batch process, the computation must be local to one machine. Requests over the network are too slow and nondeterministic. Queries to other database for example would be prohibitive.

A better approach is to take a copy of the data (peg: the database) and put it in the same distributed filesystem.

MapReduce programming model has separated the physical network communication aspects of the computation (getting the data to the right machine) from the application logic (processing the data once you have it).

In an example of a social network, small number of celebrities may have many millions of followers. Such disproportionately active database records are known as linchpin objects or hot keys.

A single reducer can lead to significant skew that is, one reducer that must process significantly more records than the others.

The skewed join method in Pig first runs a sampling job to determine which keys are hot and then records related to the hot key need to be replicated to all reducers handling that key.

Handling the hot key over several reducers is called shared join method. In Crunch is similar but requires the hot keys to be specified explicitly.

Hive's skewed join optimisation requries hot keys to be specified explicitly and it uses map-side join. If you can make certain assumptions about your input data, it is possible to make joins faster. A MapReducer job with no reducers and no sorting, each mapper simply reads one input file and writes one output file.

The output of a batch process is often not a report, but some other kind of structure.

Google's original use of MapReduce was to build indexes for its search engine. Hadoop MapReduce remains a good way of building indexes for Lucene/Solr.

If you need to perform a full-text search, a batch process is very effective way of building indexes: the mappers partition the set of documents as needed, each reducer builds the index for its partition, and the index files are written to the distributed filesystem. It pararellises very well.

Machine learning systems such as clasifiers and recommendation systems are a common use for batch processing.

Key-value stores as batch process output
The output of those batch jobs is often some kind of database.

So, how does the output from the batch process get back into a database?

Writing from the batch job directly to the database server is a bad idea:

Making a network request for every single record is magnitude slower than the normal throughput of a batch task.
Mappers or reducers concurrently write to the same output database an it can be easily overwhelmed.
You have to worry about the results from partially completed jobs being visible to other systems.
A much better solution is to build a brand-new database inside the batch job an write it as files to the job's output directory, so it can be loaded in bulk into servers that handle read-only queries. Various key-value stores support building database files in MapReduce including Voldemort, Terrapin, ElephanDB and HBase bulk loading.

By treating inputs as immutable and avoiding side effects (such as writing to external databases), batch jobs not only achieve good performance but also become much easier to maintain.

Design principles that worked well for Unix also seem to be working well for Hadoop.

The MapReduce paper was not at all new. The sections we've seen had been already implemented in so-called massively parallel processing (MPP) databases.

The biggest difference is that MPP databases focus on parallel execution of analytic SQL queries on a cluster of machines, while the combination of MapReduce and a distributed filesystem provides something much more like a general-purpose operating system that can run arbitraty programs.

Hadoop opened up the possibility of indiscriminately dumpint data into HDFS. MPP databases typically require careful upfront modeling of the data and query patterns before importing data into the database's proprietary storage format.

In MapReduce instead of forcing the producer of a dataset to bring it into a standarised format, the interpretation of the data becomes the consumer's problem.

If you have HDFS and MapReduce, you can build a SQL query execution engine on top of it, and indeed this is what the Hive project did.

If a node crashes while a query is executing, most MPP databases abort the entire query. MPP databases also prefer to keep as much data as possible in memory.

MapReduce can tolerate the failure of a map or reduce task without it affecting the job. It is also very eager to write data to disk, partly for fault tolerance, and partly because the dataset might not fit in memory anyway.

MapReduce is more appropriate for larger jobs.

At Google, a MapReduce task that runs for an hour has an approximately 5% risk of being terminated to make space for higher-priority process.

Ths is why MapReduce is designed to tolerate frequent unexpected task termination.

Beyond MapReduce
In response to the difficulty of using MapReduce directly, various higher-level programming models emerged on top of it: Pig, Hive, Cascading, Crunch.

MapReduce has poor performance for some kinds of processing. It's very robust, you can use it to process almost arbitrarily large quantities of data on an unreliable multi-tenant system with frequent task terminations, and it will still get the job done.

The files on the distributed filesystem are simply intermediate state: a means of passing data from one job to the next.

The process of writing out the intermediate state to files is called materialisation.

MapReduce's approach of fully materialising state has some downsides compared to Unix pipes:

A MapReduce job can only start when all tasks in the preceding jobs have completed, whereas rocesses connected by a Unix pipe are started at the same time.
Mappers are often redundant: they just read back the same file that was just written by a reducer.
Files are replicated across several nodes, which is often overkill for such temporary data.
To fix these problems with MapReduce, new execution engines for distributed batch computations were developed, Spark, Tez and Flink. These new ones can handle an entire workflow as one job, rather than breaking it up into independent subjobs (dataflow engines).

These functions need not to take the strict roles of alternating map and reduce, they are assembled in flexible ways, in functions called operators.

Spark, Flink, and Tex avoid writing intermediate state to HDFS, so they take a different approach to tolerating faults: if a machine fails and the intermediate state on that machine is lost, it is recomputed from other data that is still available.

The framework must keep track of how a given piece of data was computed. Spark uses the resilient distributed dataset (RDD) to track ancestry data, while Flink checkpoints operator state, allowing it to resume running an operator that ran into a fault during its execution.

Graphs and iterative processing
It's interesting to look at graphs in batch processing context, where the goal is to perform some kind of offline processing or analysis on an entire graph. This need often arises in machine learning applications such as recommednation engines, or in ranking systems.

"repeating until done" cannot be expressed in plain MapReduce as it runs in a single pass over the data and some extra trickery is necessary.

An optimisation for batch processing graphs, the bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) has become popular. It is implemented by Apache Giraph, Spark's GraphX API, and Flink's Gelly API (_Pregel model, as Google Pregel paper popularised it).

One vertex can "send a message" to another vertex, and typically those messages are sent along the edges in a graph.

The difference from MapReduce is that a vertex remembers its state in memory from one iteration to the next.

The fact that vertices can only communicate by message passing helps improve the performance of Pregel jobs, since messages can be batched.

Fault tolerance is achieved by periodically checkpointing the state of all vertices at the end of an interation.

The framework may partition the graph in arbitrary ways.

Graph algorithms often have a lot of cross-machine communication overhead, and the intermediate state is often bigger than the original graph.

If your graph can fit into memory on a single computer, it's quite likely that a single-machine algorithm will outperform a distributed batch process. If the graph is too big to fit on a single machine, a distributed approach such as Pregel is unavoidable.

Stream processing
We can run the processing continuously, abandoning the fixed time slices entirely and simply processing every event as it happens, that's the idea behind stream processing. Data that is incrementally made available over time.

Transmitting event streams
A record is more commonly known as an event. Something that happened at some point in time, it usually contains a timestamp indicating when it happened acording to a time-of-day clock.

An event is generated once by a producer (publisher or sender), and then potentially processed by multiple consumers (subcribers or recipients). Related events are usually grouped together into a topic or a stream.

A file or a database is sufficient to connect producers and consumers: a producer writes every event that it generates to the datastore, and each consumer periodically polls the datastore to check for events that have appeared since it last ran.

However, when moving toward continual processing, polling becomes expensive. It is better for consumers to be notified when new events appear.

Databases offer triggers but they are limited, so specialised tools have been developed for the purpose of delivering event notifications.

Messaging systems
Direct messaging from producers to consumers
Within the publish/subscribe model, we can differentiate the systems by asking two questions:

What happens if the producers send messages faster than the consumers can process them? The system can drop messages, buffer the messages in a queue, or apply backpressure (flow control, blocking the producer from sending more messages).
What happens if nodes crash or temporarily go offline, are any messages lost? Durability may require some combination of writing to disk and/or replication.
A number of messaging systems use direct communication between producers and consumers without intermediary nodes:

UDP multicast, where low latency is important, application-level protocols can recover lost packets.
Brokerless messaging libraries such as ZeroMQ
StatsD and Brubeck use unreliable UDP messaging for collecting metrics
If the consumer expose a service on the network, producers can make a direct HTTP or RPC request to push messages to the consumer. This is the idea behind webhooks, a callback URL of one service is registered with another service, and makes a request to that URL whenever an event occurs
These direct messaging systems require the application code to be aware of the possibility of message loss. The faults they can tolerate are quite limited as they assume that producers and consumers are constantly online.

If a consumer if offline, it may miss messages. Some protocols allow the producer to retry failed message deliveries, but it may break down if the producer crashes losing the buffer or messages.

Message brokers
An alternative is to send messages via a message broker (or message queue), which is a kind of database that is optimised for handling message streams. It runs as a server, with producers and consumers connecting to it as clients. Producers write messages to the broker, and consumers receive them by reading them from the broker.

By centralising the data, these systems can easily tolerate clients that come and go, and the question of durability is moved to the broker instead. Some brokers only keep messages in memory, while others write them down to disk so that they are not lost inc ase of a broker crash.

A consequence of queueing is that consuemrs are generally asynchronous: the producer only waits for the broker to confirm that it has buffered the message and does not wait for the message to be processed by consumers.

Some brokers can even participate in two-phase commit protocols using XA and JTA. This makes them similar to databases, aside some practical differences:

Most message brokers automatically delete a message when it has been successfully delivered to its consumers. This makes them not suitable for long-term storage.
Most message brokers assume that their working set is fairly small. If the broker needs to buffer a lot of messages, each individual message takes longer to process, and the overall throughput may degrade.
Message brokers often support some way of subscribing to a subset of topics matching some pattern.
Message brokers do not support arbitrary queries, but they do notify clients when data changes.
This is the traditional view of message brokers, encapsulated in standards like JMS and AMQP, and implemented in RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, HornetQ, Qpid, TIBCO Enterprise Message Service, IBM MQ, Azure Service Bus, and Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

When multiple consumers read messages in the same topic, to main patterns are used:

Load balancing: Each message is delivered to one of the consumers. The broker may assign messages to consumers arbitrarily.
Fan-out: Each message is delivered to all of the consumers.
In order to ensure that the message is not lost, message brokers use acknowledgements: a client must explicitly tell the broker when it has finished processing a message so that the broker can remove it from the queue.

The combination of laod balancing with redelivery inevitably leads to messages being reordered. To avoid this issue, youc an use a separate queue per consumer (not use the load balancing feature).

Partitioned logs
A key feature of barch process is that you can run them repeatedly without the risk of damaging the input. This is not the case with AMQP/JMS-style messaging: receiving a message is destructive if the acknowledgement causes it to be deleted from the broker.

If you add a new consumer to a messaging system, any prior messages are already gone and cannot be recovered.

We can have a hybrid, combining the durable storage approach of databases with the low-latency notifications facilities of messaging, this is the idea behind log-based message brokers.

A log is simply an append-only sequence of records on disk. The same structure can be used to implement a message broker: a producer sends a message by appending it to the end of the log, and consumer receives messages by reading the log sequentially. If a consumer reaches the end of the log, it waits for a notification that a new message has been appended.

To scale to higher throughput than a single disk can offer, the log can be partitioned. Different partitions can then be hosted on different machines. A topic can then be defined as a group of partitions that all carry messages of the same type.

Within each partition, the broker assigns monotonically increasing sequence number, or offset, to every message.

Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis Streams, and Twitter's DistributedLog, are log-based message brokers that work like this.

The log-based approach trivially supports fan-out messaging, as several consumers can independently read the log reading without affecint each other. Reading a message does not delete it from the log. To eachieve load balancing the broker can assign entire partitions to nodes in the consumer group. Each client then consumes all the messages in the partition it has been assigned. This approach has some downsides.

The number of nodes sharing the work of consuming a topic can be at most the number of log partitions in that topic.
If a single message is slow to process, it holds up the processing of subsequent messages in that partition.
In situations where messages may be expensive to process and you want to pararellise processing on a message-by-message basis, and where message ordering is not so important, the JMS/AMQP style of message broker is preferable. In situations with high message throughput, where each message is fast to process and where message ordering is important, the log-based approach works very well.

It is easy to tell which messages have been processed: al messages with an offset less than a consumer current offset have already been processed, and all messages with a greater offset have not yet been seen.

The offset is very similar to the log sequence number that is commonly found in single-leader database replication. The message broker behaves like a leader database, and the consumer like a follower.

If a consumer node fails, another node in the consumer group starts consuming messages at the last recorded offset. If the consumer had processed subsequent messages but not yet recorded their offset, those messages will be processed a second time upon restart.

If you only ever append the log, you will eventually run out of disk space. From time to time old segments are deleted or moved to archive.

If a slow consumer cannot keep with the rate of messages, and it falls so far behind that its consumer offset poitns to a deleted segment, it will miss some of the messages.

The throughput of a log remains more or less constant, since every message is written to disk anyway. This is in contrast to messaging systems that keep messages in memory by default and only write them to disk if the queue grows too large: systems are fast when queues are short and become much slower when they start writing to disk, throughput depends on the amount of history retained.

If a consumer cannot keep up with producers, the consumer can drop messages, buffer them or applying backpressure.

You can monitor how far a consumer is behind the head of the log, and raise an alert if it falls behind significantly.

If a consumer does fall too far behind and start missing messages, only that consumer is affected.

With AMQP and JMS-style message brokers, processing and acknowledging messages is a destructive operation, since it causes the messages to be deleted on the broker. In a log-based message broker, consuming messages is more like reading from a file.

The offset is under the consumer's control, so you can easily be manipulated if necessary, like for replaying old messages.

Databases and streams
A replciation log is a stream of a database write events, produced by the leader as it processes transactions. Followers apply that stream of writes to their own copy of the database and thus end up with an accurate copy of the same data.

If periodic full database dumps are too slow, an alternative that is sometimes used is dual writes. For example, writing to the database, then updating the search index, then invalidating the cache.

Dual writes have some serious problems, one of which is race conditions. If you have concurrent writes, one value will simply silently overwrite another value.

One of the writes may fail while the other succeeds and two systems will become inconsistent.

The problem with most databases replication logs is that they are considered an internal implementation detail, not a public API.

Recently there has been a growing interest in change data capture (CDC), which is the process of observing all data changes written to a database and extracting them in a form in which they can be replicated to other systems.

For example, you can capture the changes in a database and continually apply the same changes to a search index.

We can call log consumers derived data systems: the data stored in the search index and the data warehouse is just another view. Change data capture is a mechanism for ensuring that all changes made to the system of record are also reflected in the derived data systems.

Change data capture makes one database the leader, and turns the others into followers.

Database triggers can be used to implement change data capture, but they tend to be fragile and have significant performance overheads. Parsing the replication log can be a more robust approach.

LinkedIn's Databus, Facebook's Wormhole, and Yahoo!'s Sherpa use this idea at large scale. Bottled Watter implements CDC for PostgreSQL decoding the write-ahead log, Maxwell and Debezium for something similar for MySQL by parsing the binlog, Mongoriver reads the MongoDB oplog, and GoldenGate provide similar facilities for Oracle.

Keeping all changes forever would require too much disk space, and replaying it would take too long, so the log needs to be truncated.

You can start with a consistent snapshot of the database, and it must correspond to a known position or offset in the change log.

The storage engine periodically looks for log records with the same key, throws away any duplicates, and keeps only the most recent update for each key.

An update with a special null value (a tombstone) indicates that a key was deleted.

The same idea works in the context of log-based mesage brokers and change data capture.

RethinkDB allows queries to subscribe to notifications, Firebase and CouchDB provide data synchronisation based on change feed.

Kafka Connect integrates change data capture tools for a wide range of database systems with Kafka.

Event sourcing
There are some parallels between the ideas we've discussed here and event sourcing.

Similarly to change data capture, event sourcing involves storing all changes to the application state as a log of change events. Event sourcing applyies the idea at a different level of abstraction.

Event sourcing makes it easier to evolve applications over time, helps with debugging by making it easier to understand after the fact why something happened, and guards against application bugs.

Specialised databases such as Event Store have been developed to support applications using event sourcing.

Applications that use event sourcing need to take the log of evetns and transform it into application state that is suitable for showing to a user.

Replying the event log allows you to reconstruct the current state of the system.

Applications that use event sourcing typically have some mechanism for storing snapshots.

Event sourcing philosophy is careful to distinguis between events and commands. When a request from a user first arrives, it is initially a command: it may still fail (like some integrity condition is violated). If the validation is successful, it becomes an event, which is durable and immutable.

A consumer of the event stream is not allowed to reject an event: Any validation of a command needs to happen synchronously, before it becomes an event. For example, by using a serializable transaction that atomically validates the command and publishes the event.

Alternatively, the user request to serve a seat could be split into two events: first a tentative reservation, and then a separate confirmation event once the reservation has been validated. This split allows the validation to take place in an asynchronous process.

Whenever you have state changes, that state is the result of the events that mutated it over time.

Mutable state and an append-only log of immutable events do not contradict each other.

As an example, financial bookkeeping is recorded as an append-only ledger. It is a log of events describing money, good, or services that have changed hands. Profit and loss or the balance sheet are derived from the ledger by adding them up.

If a mistake is made, accountants don't erase or change the incorrect transaction, instead, they add another transaction that compensates for the mistake.

If buggy code writes bad data to a database, recovery is much harder if the code is able to destructively overwrite data.

Immutable events also capture more information than just the current state. If you persisted a cart into a regular database, deleting an item would effectively loose that event.

You can derive views from the same event log, Druid ingests directly from Kafka, Pistachio is a distributed key-value sotre that uses Kafka as a commit log, Kafka Connect sinks can export data from Kafka to various different databases and indexes.

Storing data is normally quite straightforward if you don't have to worry about how it is going to be queried and accessed. You gain a lot of flexibility by separating the form in which data is written from the form it is read, this idea is known as command query responsibility segregation (CQRS).

There is this fallacy that data must be written in the same form as it will be queried.

The biggest downside of event sourcing and change data capture is that consumers of the event log are usually asynchronous, a user may make a write to the log, then read from a log derived view and find that their write has not yet been reflected.

The limitations on immutable event history depends on the amount of churn in the dataset. Some workloads mostly add data and rarely update or delete; they are wasy to make immutable. Other workloads have a high rate of updates and deletes on a comparaively small dataset; in these cases immutable history becomes an issue because of fragmentation, performance compaction and garbage collection.

There may also be circumstances in which you need data to be deleted for administrative reasons.

Sometimes you may want to rewrite history, Datomic calls this feature excision.

Processing Streams
What you can do with the stream once you have it:

You can take the data in the events and write it to the database, cache, search index, or similar storage system, from where it can thenbe queried by other clients.
You can push the events to users in some way, for example by sending email alerts or push notifications, or to a real-time dashboard.
You can process one or more input streams to produce one or more output streams.
Processing streams to produce other, derived streams is what an operator job does. The one crucial difference to batch jobs is that a stream never ends.

Complex event processing (CEP) is an approach for analising event streams where you can specify rules to search for certain patterns of events in them.

When a match is found, the engine emits a complex event.

Queries are stored long-term, and events from the input streams continuously flow past them in search of a query that matches an event pattern.

Implementations of CEP include Esper, IBM InfoSphere Streams, Apama, TIBCO StreamBase, and SQLstream.

The boundary between CEP and stream analytics is blurry, analytics tends to be less interested in finding specific event sequences and is more oriented toward aggregations and statistical metrics.

Frameworks with analytics in mind are: Apache Storm, Spark Streaming, Flink, Concord, Samza, and Kafka Streams. Hosted services include Google Cloud Dataflow and Azure Stream Analytics.

Sometimes there is a need to search for individual events continually, such as full-text search queries over streams.

Message-passing ystems are also based on messages and events, we normally don't think of them as stream processors.

There is some crossover area between RPC-like systems and stream processing. Apache Storm has a feature called distributed RPC.

In a batch process, the time at which the process is run has nothing to do with the time at which the events actually occurred.

Many stream processing frameworks use the local system clock on the processing machine (processing time) to determine windowing. It is a simple approach that breaks down if there is any significant processing lag.

Confusing event time and processing time leads to bad data. Processing time may be unreliable as the stream processor may queue events, restart, etc. It's better to take into account the original event time to count rates.

You can never be sure when you have received all the events.

You can time out and declare a window ready after you have not seen any new events for a while, but it could still happen that some events are delayed due a network interruption. You need to be able to handle such stranggler events that arrive after the window has already been declared complete.

You can ignore the stranggler events, tracking the number of dropped events as a metric.
Publish a correction, an updated value for the window with stranglers included. You may also need to retrat the previous output.
To adjust for incofrrect device clocks, one approach is to log three timestamps:

The time at which the event occurred, according to the device clock
The time at which the event was sent to the server, according to the device clock
The time at which the event was received by the server, according to the server clock.
You can estimate the offset between the device clock and the server clock, then apply that offset to the event timestamp, and thus estimate the true time at which the event actually ocurred.

Several types of windows are in common use:

Tumbling window: Fixed length. If you have a 1-minute tumbling window, all events between 10:03:00 and 10:03:59 will be grouped in one window, next window would be 10:04:00-10:04:59
Hopping window: Fixed length, but allows windows to overlap in order to provide some smoothing. If you have a 5-minute window with a hop size of 1 minute, it would contain the events between 10:03:00 and 10:07:59, next window would cover 10:04:00-10:08:59
Sliding window: Events that occur within some interval of each other. For example, a 5-minute sliding window would cover 10:03:39 and 10:08:12 because they are less than 4 minutes apart.
Session window: No fixed duration. All events for the same user, the window ends when the user has been inactive for some time (30 minutes). Common in website analytics
The fact that new events can appear anytime on a stream makes joins on stream challenging.

Stream-stream joins
You want to detect recent trends in searched-for URLs. You log an event containing the query. Someone clicks one of the search results, you log another event recording the click. You need to bring together the events for the search action and the click action.

For this type of join, a stream processor needs to maintain state: All events that occurred in the last hour, indexed by session ID. Whenever a search event or click event occurs, it is added to the appropriate index, and the stream processor also checks the other index to see if another event for the same session ID has already arrived. If there is a matching event, you emit an event saying search result was clicked.

Stream-table joins
Sometimes know as enriching the activity events with information from the database.

Imagine two datasets: a set of usr activity events, and a database of user profiles. Activity events include the user ID, and the the resulting stream should have the augmented profile information based upon the user ID.

The stream process needs to look at one activity event at a time, look up the event's user ID in the database, and add the profile information to the activity event. THe database lookup could be implemented by querying a remote database., however this would be slow and risk overloading the database.

Another approach is to load a copy of the database into the stream processor so that it can be queried locally without a network round-trip. The stream processor's local copy of the database needs to be kept up to date; this can be solved with change data capture.

Table-table join
The stream process needs to maintain a database containing the set of followers for each user so it knows which timelines need to be updated when a new tweet arrives.

Time-dependence join
The previous three types of join require the stream processor to maintain some state.

If state changes over time, and you join with some state, what point in time do you use for the join?

If the ordering of events across streams is undetermined, the join becomes nondeterministic.

This issue is known as slowly changing dimension (SCD), often addressed by using a unique identifier for a particular version of the joined record. For example, we can turn the system deterministic if every time the tax rate changes, it is given a new identifier, and the invoice includes the identifier for the tax rate at the time of sale. But as a consequence makes log compation impossible.

Fault tolerance
Batch processing frameworks can tolerate faults fairly easy:if a task in a MapReduce job fails, it can simply be started again on another machine, input files are immutable and the output is written to a separate file.

Even though restarting tasks means records can be processed multiple times, the visible effect in the output is as if they had only been processed once (exactly-once-semantics or effectively-once).

With stream processing waiting until a tasks if finished before making its ouput visible is not an option, stream is infinite.

One solution is to break the stream into small blocks, and treat each block like a minuature batch process (micro-batching). This technique is used in Spark Streaming, and the batch size is typically around one second.

An alternative approach, used in Apache Flint, is to periodically generate rolling checkpoints of state and write them to durable storage. If a stream operator crashes, it can restart from its most recent checkpoint.

Microbatching and chekpointing approaches provide the same exactly-once semantics as batch processing. However, as soon as output leaves the stream processor, the framework is no longer able to discard the output of a failed batch.

In order to give appearance of exactly-once processing, things either need to happen atomically or none of must happen. Things should not go out of sync of each other. Distributed transactions and two-phase commit can be used.

This approach is used in Google Cloud Dataflow and VoltDB, and there are plans to add similar features to Apache Kafka.

Our goal is to discard the partial output of failed tasks so that they can be safely retired without taking effect twice. Distributed transactions are one way of achieving that goal, but another way is to rely on idempotence.

An idempotent operation is one that you can perform multiple times, and it has the same effect as if you performed it only once.

Even if an operation is not naturally idempotent, it can often be made idempotent with a bit of extra metadata. You can tell wether an update has already been applied.

Idempotent operations can be an effective way of achieving exactly-once semantics with only a small overhead.

Any stream process that requires state must ensure tha this state can be recovered after a failure.

One option is to keep the state in a remote datastore and replicate it, but it is slow.

An alternative is to keep state local to the stream processor and replicate it periodically.

Flink periodically captures snapshots and writes them to durable storage such as HDFS; Samza and Kafka Streams replicate state changes by sending them to a dedicated Kafka topic with log compaction. VoltDB replicates state by redundantly processing each input message on several nodes.

The future of data systems
Data integration
Updating a derived data system based on an event log can often be made determinisitic and idempotent.

Distributed transactions decide on an ordering of writes by using locks for mutual exclusion, while CDC and event sourcing use a log for ordering. Distributed transactions use atomic commit to ensure exactly once semantics, while log-based systems are based on deterministic retry and idempotence.

Transaction systems provide linearizability, useful guarantees as reading your own writes. On the other hand, derived systems are often updated asynchronously, so they do not by default offer the same timing guarantees.

In the absence of widespread support for a good distributed transaction protocol, log-based derived data is the most promising approach for integrating different data systems.

However, as systems are scaled towards bigger and more coplex worloads, limitiations emerge:

Constructing a totally ordered log requires all events to pass through a single leader node that decides on the ordering.
An undefined ordering of events that originate on multiple datacenters.
When two events originate in different services, there is no defined order for those events.
Some applications maintain client-side state. Clients and servers are very likely to see events in different orders.
Deciding on a total order of events is known as total order broadcast, which is equivalent to consensus. It is still an open research problem to design consensus algorithms that can scale beyond the throughput of a single node.

Batch and stream processing
The fundamental difference between batch processors and batch processes is that the stream processors operate on unbounded datasets whereas batch processes inputs are of a known finite size.

Spark performs stream processing on top of batch processing. Apache Flink performs batch processing in top of stream processing.

Batch processing has a quite strong functional flavour. The output depends only on the input, there are no side-effects. Stream processing is similar but it allows managed, fault-tolerant state.

Derived data systems could be maintained synchronously. However, asynchrony is what makes systems based on event logs robust: it allows a fault in one part of the system to be contained locally.

Stream processing allows changes in the input to be reflected in derived views with low delay, whereas batch processing allows large amounts of accumulated historical data to be reprocessed in order to derive new views onto an existing dataset.

Derived views allow gradual evolution. If you want to restructure a dataset, you do not need to perform the migration as a sudden switch. Instead, you can maintain the old schema and the new schema side by side as two independent derived views onto the same underlying data, eventually you can drop the old view.

Lambda architecture
The whole idea behind lambda architecture is that incoming data should be recorded by appending immutable events to an always-growing dataset, similarly to event sourcing. From these events, read-optimised vuews are derived. Lambda architecture proposes running two different systems in parallel: a batch processing system such as Hadoop MapReduce, and a stream-processing system as Storm.

The stream processor produces an approximate update to the view: the batch processor produces a corrected version of the derived view.

The stream process can use fast approximation algorithms while the batch process uses slower exact algorithms.

Unbundling databases
Creating an index
Batch and stream processors are like elaborate implementations of triggers, stored procedures, and materialised view maintenance routines. The derived data systems they maintain are like different index types.

There are two avenues by which different storate and processing tools can nevertheless be composed into a cohesive system:

Federated databases: unifying reads. It is possible to provide a unified query interface to a wide variety of underlying storate engines and processing methods, this is known as federated database or polystore. An example is PostgreSQL's foreign data wrapper.
Unbundled databases: unifying writes. When we compose several storage systems, we need to ensure that all data changes end up in all the right places, even in the face of faults, it is like unbundling a database's index-maintenance features in a way that can synchronise writes across disparate technologies.
Keeping the writes to several storage systems in sync is the harder engineering problem.

Synchronising writes requires distributed transactions across heterogeneous storage systems which may be the wrong solution. An asynchronous event log with idempotent writes is a much more robust and practical approach.

The big advantage is loose coupling between various components:

Asynchronous event streams make the system as a whole more robust to outages or performance degradation of individual components.
Unbundling data systems allows different software components and services to be developed, improved and maintained independently from each other by different teams.
If there is a single technology that does everything you need, you're most likely best off simply using that product rather than trying to reimplement it yourself from lower-level components. The advantages of unbundling and composition only come into the picture when there is no single piece of software that satisfies all your requirements.

Separation of application code and state
It makes sense to have some parts of a system that specialise in durable data storage, and other parts that specialise in running application code. The two can interact while still remaining independent.

The trend has been to keep stateless application logic separate from state management (databases): not putting application logic in the database and not putting persistent state in the application.

Dataflow, interplay between state changes and application code
Instead of treating the database as a passive variable that is manipulated by the application, application code responds to state changes in one place by triggering state changes in another place.

Stream processors and services
A customer is purchasing an item that is priced in one currency but paid in another currency. In order to perform the currency conversion, you need to know the current exchange rate.

This could be implemented in two ways:

Microservices approach, the code that processes the purchase would probably wuery an exchange-rate service or a database in order to obtain the current rate for a particular currency.
Dataflow approach, the code that processes purchases would subscribe to a stream of exchange rate updates ahead of time, and record the current rate in a local database whenever it changes. When it comes to processing the purchase, it only needs to query the local database.
The dataflow is not only faster, but it is also more robust to the failure of another service.

Observing derived state
Materialised views and caching
A full-text search index is a good example: the write path updates the index, and the read path searches the index for keywords.

If you don't have an index, a search query would have to scan over all documents, which is very expensive. No index means less work on the write path (no index to update), but a lot more work on the read path.

Another option would be to precompute the search results for only a fixed set of the most common queries. The uncommon queries can still be served from the inxed. This is what we call a cache although it could also be called a materialised view.

Read are events too
It is also possible to represent read requests as streams of events, and send both the read events and write events through a stream processor; the processor responds to read events by emiting the result of the read to an output stream.

It would allow you to reconstruct what the user saw before they made a particular decision.

Enables better tracking of casual dependencies.

Aiming for correctness
If your application can tolerate occasionally corrupting or losing data in unpredictable ways, life is a lot simpler. If you need stronger assurances of correctness, the serializability and atomic commit are established approaches.

While traditional transaction approach is not going away, there are some ways of thinking about correctness in the context of dataflow architectures.

The end-to-end argument for databases
Bugs occur, and people make mistakes. Favour of immutable and append-only data, because it is easier to recover from such mistakes.

We've seen the idea of exactly-once (or effectively-once) semantics. If something goes wrong while processing a message, you can either give up or try again. If you try again, there is the risk that it actually succeeded the first time, the message ends up being processed twice.

Exactly-once means arranging the computation such that the final effect is the same as if no faults had occurred.

One of the most effective approaches is to make the operation idempotent, to ensure that it has the same effect, no matter whether it is executed once or multiple times. Idempotence requires some effort and care: you may need to maintain some additional metadata (operation IDs), and ensure fencing when failing over from one node to another.

Two-phase commit unfortunately is not sufficient to ensure that the transaction will only be executed once.

You need to consider end-to-end flow of the request.

You can generate a unique identifier for an operation (such as a UUID) and include it as a hidden form field in the client application, or calculate a hash of all the relevant form fields to derive the operation ID. If the web browser submits the POST request twice, the two requests will have the same operation ID. You can then pass that operation ID all the way through to the database and check that you only ever execute one operation with a given ID. You can then save those requests to be processed, uniquely identified by the operation ID.

Is not enough to prevent a user from submitting a duplicate request if the first one times out. Solving the problem requires an end-to-end solution: a transaction indentifier that is passed all the way from the end-user client to the database.

Low-level reliability mechanisms such as those in TCP, work quite well, and so the remaining higher-level faults occur fairly rarely.

Transactions have long been seen as a good abstraction, they are useful but not enough.

It is worth exploring F=fault-tolerance abstractions that make it easy to provide application-specific end-to-end correctness properties, but also maintain good performance and good operational characteristics.

Enforcing constraints
Uniqueness constraints require consensus
The most common way of achieving consensus is to make a single node the leadder, and put it in charge of making all decisions. If you need to tolerate the leader failing, you're back at the consensus problem again.

Uniqueness checking can be scaled out by partitioning based on the value that needs to be unique. For example, if you need usernames to be unique, you can partition by hash or username.

Asynchronous multi-master replication is ruled out as different masters concurrently may accept conflicting writes, so values are no longer unique. If you want to be able to immediately reject any writes that would violate the constraint, synchronous coordination is unavoidable.

Uniqueness in log-based messaging
A stream processor consumes all the messages in a log partition sequentially on a single thread. A stream processor can unambiguously and deterministically decide which one of several conflicting operations came first.

Every request for a username is encoded as a message.
A stream processor sequentially reads the requests in the log. For every request for a username tht is available, it records the name as taken and emits a success message to an output stream. For every request for a username that is already taken, it emits a rejection message to an output stream.
The client waits for a success or rejection message corresponding to its request.
The approach works not only for uniqueness constraints, but also for many other kinds of constraints.

Multi-partition request processing
There are potentially three partitions: the one containing the request ID, the one containing the payee account, and one containing the payer account.

The traditional approach to databases, executing this transaction would require an atomic commit across all three partitions.

Equivalent correctness can be achieved with partitioned logs, and without an atomic commit.

The request to transfer money from account A to account B is given a unique request ID by the client, and appended to a log partition based on the request ID.
A stream processor reads the log of requests. For each request message it emits two messages to output streams: a debit instruction to the payer account A (partitioned by A), and a credit instruction to the payee account B (partitioned by B). The original request ID is included in those emitted messages.
Further processors consume the streams of credit and debit instructions, deduplicate by request ID, and apply the chagnes to the account balances.
Timeliness and integrity
Consumers of a log are asynchronous by design, so a sender does not wait until its message has been proccessed by consumers. However, it is possible for a client to wait for a message to appear on an output stream.

Consistency conflates two different requirements:

Timeliness: users observe the system in an up-to-date state.
Integrity: Means absence of corruption. No data loss, no contradictory or false data. The derivation must be correct.
Violations of timeless are "eventual consistency" whereas violations of integrity are "perpetual inconsistency".

Correctness and dataflow systems
When processing event streams asynchronously, there is no guarantee of timeliness, unless you explicitly build consumers that wait for a message to arrive before returning. But integrity is in fact central to streaming systems.

Exactly-once or effectively-once semantics is a mechanism for preserving integrity. Fault-tolerant message delivery and duplicate supression are important for maintaining the integrity of a data system in the face of faults.

Stream processing systems can preserve integrity without requireing distributed transactions and an atomic commit protocol, which means they can potentially achieve comparable correctness with much better performance and operational robustness. Integrity can be achieved through a combination of mechanisms:

Representing the content of the write operation as a single message, this fits well with event-sourcing
Deriving all other state updates from that single message using deterministic derivation functions
Passing a client-generated request ID, enabling end-to-end duplicate supression and idempotence
Making messages immutable and allowing derived data to be reprocessed from time to time
In many businesses contexts, it is actually acceptable to temporarily violate a constraint and fix it up later apologising. The cost of the apology (money or reputation), it is often quite low.

Coordination-avoiding data-systems
Dataflow systems can maintain integrity guarantees on derived data without atomic commit, linearizability, or synchronous cross-partition coordination.
Although strict uniqueness constraints require timeliness and coordination, many applications are actually fine with loose constraints than may be temporarily violated and fixed up later.
Dataflow systems can provide the data management services for many applications without requiring coordination, while still giving strong integrity guarantees. Coordination-avoiding data systems can achieve better performance and fault tolerance than systems that need to perform synchronous coordination.

Trust, but verify
Checking the integrity of data is know as auditing.

If you want to be sure that your data is still there, you have to actually read it and check. It is important to try restoring from your backups from time to time. Don't just blindly trust that it is working.

Self-validating or self-auditing systems continually check their own integrity.

ACID databases has led us toward developing applications on the basis of blindly trusting technology, neglecting any sort of auditability in the process.

By contrast, event-based systems can provide better auditability (like with event sourcing).

Cryptographic auditing and integrity checking often relies on Merkle trees. Outside of the hype for cryptocurrencies, certificate transparency is a security technology that relies on Merkle trees to check the validity of TLS/SSL certificates.

Doing the right thing
Many datasets are about people: their behaviour, their interests, their identity. We must treat such data with humanity and respect. Users are humans too, and human dignitity is paramount.

There are guidelines to navigate these issues such as ACM's Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice

It is not sufficient for software engineers to focus exclusively on the technology and ignore its consequences: the ethical responsibility is ours to bear also.

In countries that respect human rights, the criminal justice system presumes innocence until proven guilty; on the other hand, automated systems can systematically and artbitrarily exclude a person from participating in society without any proof of guilt, and with little chance of appeal.

If there is a systematic bias in the input to an algorithm, the system will most likely learn and amplify bias in its output.

It seems ridiculous to believe that an algorithm could somehow take biased data as input and produce fair and impartial output from it. Yet this believe often seems to be implied by proponents of data-driven decision making.

If we want the future to be better than the past, moral imagination is required, and that's something only humans can provide. Data and models should be our tools, not our masters.

If a human makes a mistake, they can be held accountable. Algorithms make mistakes too, but who is accountable if they go wrong?

A credit score summarises "How did you behave in the past?" whereas predictive analytics usually work on the basis of "Who is similar to you, and how did people like you behave in the past?" Drawing parallels to others' behaviour implies stereotyping people.

We will also need to figure outhow to prevent data being used to harm people, and realise its positive potential instead, this power could be used to focus aid an support to help people who most need it.

When services become good at predicting what content users want to se, they may end up showing people only opinions they already agree with, leading to echo chambers in which stereotypes, misinformation and polaristaion can breed.

Many consequences can be predicted by thinking about the entire system (not just the computerised parts), an approach known as systems thinking.

Privacy and tracking
When a system only stores data that a user has explicitly entered, because they want the system to store and process it in a certain way, the system is performing a service for the user: the user is the customer.

But when a user's activity is tracked and logged as a side effect of other things they are doing, the relationship is less clear. The service no longer just does what the users tells it to do, but it takes on interests of its own, which may conflict with the user's interest.

If the service is funded through advertising, the advertirsers are the actual customers, and the users' interests take second place.

The user is given a free service and is coaxed into engaging with it as much as possible. The tracking of the user serves the needs of the advertirses who are funding the service. This is basically surveillance.

As a thougt experiment, try replacing the word data with surveillance.

Even themost totalitarian and repressive regimes could only dream of putting a microphone in every room and forcing every person to constantly carry a device capable of tracking their location and movements. Yet we apparently voluntarily, even enthusiastically, throw ourselves into this world of total surveillance. The difference is just that the data is being collected by corporations rather than government agencies.

Perhaps you feel you have nothing to hide, you are totally in line with existing power structures, you are not a marginalised minority, and you needn't fear persecution. Not everyone is so fortunate.

Without understanding what happens to their data, users cannot give any meaningful consent. Often, data from one user also says things about other people who are not users of the service and who have not agreed to any terms.

For a user who does not consent to surveillance, the only real alternative is simply to not user the service. But this choice is not free either: if a service is so popular that it is "regarded by most people as essential for basic social participation", then it is not reasonable to expect people to opt out of this service. Especially when a service has network effects, there is a social cost to people choosing not to use it.

Declining to use a service due to its tracking of users is only an option for the small number of people who are priviledged enough to have the time and knowledge to understand its privacy policy, and who can affort to potentially miss out on social participation or professional opportunities that may have arisen if they ahd participated in the service. For people in a less priviledged position, there is no meaningful freedom of choice: surveillance becomes inescapable.

Having privacy does not mean keeping everything secret; it means having the freedom to choose which things to reveal to whom, what to make public, and what to keep secret.

Companies that acquire data essentially say "trust us to do the right thing with your data" which means that the right to decide what to reveal and what to keep secret is transferred from the individual to the company.

Even if the service promises not to sell the data to third parties, it usually grants itself unrestricted rights to process and analyse the data internally, often going much further than what is overtly visible to users.

If targeted advertising is what pays for a service, then behavioral data about people is the service's core asset.

When collecting data, we need to consider not just today's political environment, but also future governments too. There is no guarantee that every government elected in the future will respect human rights and civil liberties, so "it is poor civic hygiene to install technologies that could someday facilitate a police state".

To scrutinise others while avoiding scrutiny oneself is one of the most important forms of power.

In the industrial revolution tt took a long time before safeguards were established, such as environmental protection regulations, safety protocols for workplaces, outlawing child labor, and health inspections for food. Undoubtedly the cost of doing business increased when factories could no longer dump their waste into rivers, sell tainted foods, or exploit workers. But society as a whole benefited hugely, and few of us would want to return to a time before those regulations.

We should stop regarding users as metrics to be optimised, and remember that they are humans who deserve respect, dignity, and agency. We should self-regulate our data collection and processing practices in order to establish an maintain the trust of the people who depend on our software. And we should take it upon ourselves to educate end users about how their data is used, rather than keeping them in the dark.

We should allow each individual to maintain their privacy, their control over their own data, and not steal that control from them through surveillance.

We should not retain data forever, but purge it as soon as it is no longer needed.
